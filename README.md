# Window Manager agnostic swallowing feature for terminal emulators

Devour hides your terminal window before launching an external program and unhides it after quitting.

Devour is the successor to
[BSPWM_Swallow](https://github.com/salman-abedin/bspwm_swallow)
and a fork of
[sw](https://github.com/ronniedroid/.dotfiles/blob/master/Scripts/sw) by
[ronniedroid](https://github.com/ronniedroid)

## Dependencies

-  [xdo](https://github.com/baskerville/xdo)

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/salman-abedin/devour.git && cd devour && sudo make install
```

## Usage

```sh
devour [CMD...]
```

## Pro Tip

**Devour from your file browser instead of shell**

**Hint:** I'm sure most of you are using the abomination of a thing called **xdg-open** instead of writing your own launch script which is not that hard to write by any standard.

However, since you are stuck with that, go to your **~/.local/share/applications** directory and modify the applications you launch from the terminal like below to enjoy some premium devouring.

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=PDF Reader
Exec=/usr/local/bin/devour /usr/bin/zathura %U
```

## Uninstallation

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```
